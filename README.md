Author: Chunliang Mu

Requrie python 3.10+ (since I am using the | operator for type hints)


This library is written by me for my PhD project, see below:



Project20230125: Radiative Transfer (RT) in Common Envelope Evolution (CEE)


Creator: Chunliang Mu (PhD student at Macquarie University 2023-2026(expected), Student ID 47586591)
Principal Supervisor: Professor Orsola De Marco
Associate Supervisor: Professor Mark Wardle


This Project20230125 is my PhD project at Macquarie Uni.
See my research diary on Notion.so website.

----------

This sub-project (20230201) is a sub project of Project 20230125.
Its goal is for me to learn about the tools available and used in the research group (Lead by my supervisor Prof Osola De Marco at Macquarie University).
By "tools" I mean softwares and codes such as Phantom, Splash, and sarracen.
It is also a place for me to experiment and test my knowledge on Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), CEE, and RT.
This subproject has also produced the photosphere cross-section and size-evolution plot for Luis' 2023 paper on CEE dust.
