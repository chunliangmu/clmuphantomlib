----------

Please note that this library is still under development.
I am putting the code online in the hope that it would be helpful; but I do NOT guarantee it will work.
Use it at your own discretion!
I hope it helps.

----------

Dependencies - Python libraries:
	python (version >= 3.10)
	numpy scipy astropy numba matplotlib ipympl moviepy
	sarracen

	(
		In the future I might add h5py as well.
		I think that's all.
		If that doesn't work, try install all of those with anaconda:
		numpy scipy astropy sympy h5py numba pandas seaborn matplotlib ipympl ipynbname pylint moviepy jupyter jupyterlab
		and then install ``sarracen`` with pip.
	)
